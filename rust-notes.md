# Rust Learning

## Ownership

- each vairable can only have one owner at a time, and when that owner goes out of scope tha value is dropped
- you can get around this with `.clone()` which creates a deep copy
  - however if you do `let b = a` then you cannot now reference a because the value at a is now owned by b
- you can make variables equal to references to other vars using `&` or `&mut`

  - `&` is immutable and thus you cannot change the value only view it
  - `&mut` is mutable and allows you to diretly modify the value you are referencing

    - if you reference a var with one type of reference you cannot reference it with another type, ie.:
      ```Rust
      let a = &name
      let b = &mut name // will not compile
      ```
    - however due to NLL, if a is not used again after the declaration of b then it will compile, since a is dropped if its not used

      ```Rust
      let a = &name
      println!("{}", a)

      let b = &mut name // will compile
      ```

## Enums & Matching

- enums let you define types that could be one of several variants
  - each variant can hold data
  - enums must be capitalized
- you use `match` to destructure and handle each case

  ```Rust
  // example
  enum Message {
        Quit,
        Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
        Write(String),
    }

  fn handle_message(msg: Message) {
      match msg {
        Message::Quit => println!("Quit"),
        Message::Move { x, y } => println!("Move to ({}, {})", x, y),
        Message::Write(text) => println!("Write: {}", text),
      }
  }
  ```

## Vocabulary

- **Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL)**: A variableâ€™s lifetime ends when it is no longer used, not necessarily when its scope ends
